PMFPredictor Toolkit

This repository contains the sets of files and scripts needed to generate PMFs via a machine-learning approach employing an expansion in hypergeometric coefficients, and this document explains how to use them.

Contents
===========
The toolkit contains a number of scripts, broadly divided into levels as follows (see the PMFPredictorWorkflow.pdf flowchart for a high-level summary)

Level 0: Pre-processing of surface and chemical structures.
ACPYPE2CSV.py: A small helper script that calls ACPYPE (which must be installed separately) to convert SMILES codes into the CSV molecular format used by the rest of the toolkit. This is kept in its own folder due to the large volume of output generated during operation.
NPtoCSV.py: A tool for converting NP structures generated using CHARMM-GUI to the CSV molecular format used by the toolkit. GROMACS output must be enabled during operation of CHARMM-GUI and by default it uses non-equilibriated structures but this can be edited - any .gro file containing co-ordinates can be used as input.

Level 1: Generation of potentials.
GenerateSurfacePotentials.py: Takes in a set of CSV-formatted surface structures and calculates the free energy for a carbon-like probe, a point charge, and water.
GenerateChemicalPotentials.py : Takes in a set of CSV-formatted chemical structures and calculates the free energy for a carbon-like probe, a carbon-like slab, a point charge, and water.

Level 2: Extraction of hypergeometric expansion (HGE) coefficients
HGExpandSurfacePotential.py, HGExpandChemicalPotential.py : Construct HGExpansions of the potentials obtained using the scripts in level 1 for all surfaces and chemicals.
HGExpandPMFs.py : Constructs HGExpansions of the PMFs used for training. 

Level 3: Neural network training
BuildPMFPredictor.py: Constructs and trains the ANN used to convert HG coefficients describing the input potentials to the coefficients describing a PMF.

Level 4: PMF output
PredictPMFs.py: Generates PMFs for all surface/chemical pairs using the model trained in Level 3.

===========
Source?
===========
The "source" variable for a surface defines whether it should be treated as a Stockholm-style calculation (if 0) or a UCD style (if 1). These most obviously lead to differences for gold, for which UCD-style has a large water peak and Stockholm-style does not. The choice for new materials is left to the user but it should be noted that there are significantly more Stockholm-style PMFs in the training set covering a wider range of materials.


===========
AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON TRAINING/VALIDATION/TEST splits
===========
All PMFS in either "AllPMFsRegularised" or "AllPMFS" are considered fair game for model development - the scripts used to generate the datasets are greedy and will read these in if they are present. Thus, anything which should be kept for sight-unseen testing should not be added to this folder. As a failsafe, the script skips these if either the surface or chemical are not registered in the definitions files.
The training/validation splits used to optimise parameters/hyperparameters are randomly generated.

Workflow for generating PMFs for new surfaces
===========
1) Generate a set of combined coordinate files for all the atoms in the structure, place in Structures/Surfaces. This requires co-ordinates, masses, charges, and LJ 6-12 coefficients for each atom present.
	- Suggested method: use CHARMMGUI with GROMACS output enabled and apply NPtoCSV.py by editing the list of targets to the folder downloaded from CHARMMGUI.
2) Update Structures/SurfaceDefinitions.csv to register your new surface. Generally, you can use the default settings which look like "CNT15,cylinder,35,0,35,0", just replacing the name and shape as needed.
	- If you are trying to compare these to pre-existing PMFs then you might need to edit the last two numbers to manual alignment mode at a target energy. The final number is set to 1 in this case. The penultimate number is the point in the PMF used for alignment and should be as close to 35 as possible for consistency - this value usually works to find the pure repulsive region, even when the PMFs have been back-filled.
3) Run GenerateSurfacePotentials.py to build the free-energy probe and water tables describing all materials listed in the SurfaceDefinitions.csv table. This may take up to half an hour for each, possibly longer depending on the size of your surface. This will also update the material_offsets file used to help align pre-existing PMFs.
4) Run HGExpandSurfacePotential.py to generate the expansion coefficients describing the materials.

It is not recommended to include water! This is in principle added by the ML model, so use dry structures only for consistency.

Workflow for generating PMFs for new chemicals
===========
1)  Generate a set of combined coordinate files for all the atoms in the structure, place in Structures/Chemicals. This requires co-ordinates, masses, charges, and LJ 6-12 coefficients for each atom present.
	- Suggested method: use ChemicalFromACPYPE.py script if you have ACPYPE installed. This scans over a list of target SMILES codes and IDs to build the structure and put it into the correct format. If your molecule has chirality thats 		not specified by the SMILES code you should be careful to make sure it's been correctly generated. I would recommend appending "-AC" to the ID target to make it clear it was made by ACPYPE, but this is not mandatory.
2) Update Structures/ChemicalDefinitions.csv to register your new chemical. This has the format ID,SMILES,formal charge,comment. The comment cannot include commas (because its a csv file) but otherwise can contain arbitrary text, e.g. force 	field and method used to generate the structure, a descriptive name, etc.
3) Run GenerateChemicalPotentials.py
4) Run HGExpandChemicalPotential.py to generate the table of expansion coefficients

Advice on naming surfaces and chemicals
===========
Use short but descriptive names - standard characters are fine except for underscores. This is because the scripts used for reading in and out PMFs assume filenames of the form materialname_chemicalname so if you put underscores in expect errors to take place.
